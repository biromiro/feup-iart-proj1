## Problem Specification

Given a grid-like map, with walls placed in between some cells, a robot must be programmed with a set of instructions of minimal size which, when repeated sequentially, find a valid path between the Start and Finish position.

## Problem Formulation

### State Representation

Instruction List (e.g [U, D, R])

### Initial State

Empty Lisr ( [] )

### Objective Test

Run the instructions while there are no cycles, i.e a set of instructions does not end up on a previously starting square.

### Operators

- Add_Right - Adds the â€˜Râ€™ instruction to the end of the instruction list
- Add_Left - Adds the â€˜Lâ€™ instruction to the end of the instruction list
- Add_Up - Adds the â€˜Uâ€™ instruction to the end of the instruction list
- Add_Down - Adds the â€˜Dâ€™ instruction to the end of the instruction list

### Heuristics

Heuristics for this problem are hard to define due to:

- the cyclic and infinite nature of the instruction list
- the interactions with the walls on the grid

These properties elevate the potential of a single new instruction to near-limitless, which severely limits the admissibility of heuristics.
